## Phase 4: Performance & Polish ✅ COMPLETED

### Performance optimizations completed:

- ✅ Added React.memo to all refactored message components (ConversationList, ChatArea, MessageInput, TypingIndicator, NewConversationCard)
- ✅ Verified all lucide-react imports already use named imports (no optimization needed)
- ✅ Added ErrorBoundary to critical components (ProductGrid, SearchResults)
- ✅ Verified ErrorBoundary already implemented in main layouts (web and app)
- ✅ Verified loading skeletons already exist for all async components (ProductGrid, SearchResults, Messages, Checkout, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented virtualization for large lists using @tanstack/react-virtual
  - ✅ ProductGrid component: Smart virtualization (enabled for 50+ items)
  - ✅ SearchResults component: Smart virtualization (enabled for 50+ items)
  - ✅ ConversationList component: Smart virtualization (enabled for 100+ items)
  - ✅ Automatic fallback to non-virtualized rendering for smaller lists
  - ✅ Responsive column calculations for different screen sizes
  - ✅ Proper height estimation and overscan for smooth scrolling

### Result: Complete performance optimization suite with React.memo, error boundaries, and virtualization ✅
