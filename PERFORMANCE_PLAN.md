## Success Metrics
Track these metrics before and after implementation:

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target < 2.5s  
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Target < 3.5s
- **Bundle Size**: Target 50% reduction in initial load
- **Database Query Time**: Target 90% reduction

### User Experience Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: Target 50-70% improvement
- **Navigation Speed**: Target instant for cached pages
- **Admin Dashboard**: Target < 1s load time
- **Product Listings**: Target pagination prevents crashes

## Testing Strategy
After each phase:
1. Run `pnpm build` to check bundle size
2. Test with `pnpm dev` for development performance
3. Run Lighthouse audits for performance scores
4. Test with realistic data volumes (1000+ products)
5. Monitor Redis cache hit rates
6. Check database query performance with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

## Rollback Plan
Each optimization is independent and can be reverted:
- Database indexes: Can be dropped if issues arise
- PPR: Can be disabled in config
- Dynamic imports: Can be reverted to static imports
- Caching: Can be bypassed with feature flags

## Dependencies
- Redis must be configured for caching features
- Database must support composite indexes (PostgreSQL ✓)
- Next.js 15 features require latest version (✓)
- Prisma indexes require `pnpm db:push` deployment

## Estimated Timeline
- **Week 1**: Database fixes, pagination, PPR (Critical fixes)
- **Week 2**: Streaming, bundle optimization, caching (Major gains)  
- **Week 3**: Polish, edge runtime, final testing (Production ready)

**Total**: 12 development days for complete optimization
