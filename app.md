**App**: `/apps/app` - Authenticated user dashboard  
**Status**: ~85% Complete  
**Priority**: Critical for transactions  

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL FIXES (Must Have for Launch)

### 1. ❌ Re-enable Stripe Connect Enforcement
**Current**: Commented out - anyone can list without payment setup  
**File**: `/apps/app/app/(authenticated)/selling/new/page.tsx`  
**Fix**:
```typescript
// Re-enable this protection:
const { stripeConnectedAccountId, stripeAccountStatus } = seller;

if (!stripeConnectedAccountId || stripeAccountStatus !== 'connected') {
  redirect('/selling/onboarding');
}
```

### 2. ❌ Complete Analytics Charts
**Current**: "Coming soon" placeholder  
**File**: `/apps/app/app/(authenticated)/selling/dashboard/components/analytics-charts.tsx`  
**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Replace placeholders with real charts using Recharts:
- Revenue over time (line chart)
- Top performing products (bar chart)
- Traffic sources (pie chart)
- Conversion funnel (funnel chart)
- Sales by category (donut chart)
```

### 3. ❌ Email Notifications
**Current**: Code exists but not activated  
**Files**: Various action files  
**Enable**:
```typescript
// Order confirmation email
await sendEmail({
  to: buyer.email,
  subject: 'Order Confirmed - Threadly',
  template: 'order-confirmation',
  data: { order, items }
});

// Shipping notification
await sendEmail({
  to: buyer.email,
  subject: 'Your order has shipped!',
  template: 'order-shipped',
  data: { order, trackingNumber }
});
```

### 4. ❌ Real-time Order Updates
**Current**: No live notifications  
**Implementation**:
- Use Pusher channels for order status updates
- Show toast notifications for new orders (sellers)
- Update order status in real-time
- Browser notifications for important events

### 5. ❌ Product Validation Errors
**Issue**: Form validation not user-friendly  
**File**: `/apps/app/app/(authenticated)/selling/new/components/product-form.tsx`
