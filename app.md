## Architecture Overview

### Mobile-First Admin Dashboard Architecture

#### Core Navigation System
Using shadcn/ui Sidebar with Mobile Optimization:
- **Collapsible**: "offcanvas" mode for mobile overlay behavior
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px height for all interactive elements
- **Responsive**: Adapts between mobile drawer and desktop sidebar
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-side rendered with client interactivity

#### Layout Patterns
1. **Responsive Grid System**
   - Mobile-first breakpoints: xs(480px), sm(640px), md(768px), lg(1024px)
   - CSS Grid with dynamic column spanning
   - Card-based layouts for mobile readability

2. **Progressive Data Tables**
   - Desktop: Traditional table view with horizontal scrolling
   - Mobile: Card-based view with key information
   - Touch-optimized actions and interactions

3. **Mobile Form Patterns**
   - Multi-step wizards for complex forms
   - Touch-friendly input controls
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Optimized keyboard interactions

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach
- **State Management**: Server Components + Client islands
- **Caching**: Redis (Upstash) with cache.remember()
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Payments**: Stripe integration

## CLAUDE.md Compliance

### âœ… Fully Compliant Areas
1. **Zero `any` Types**: All audited pages have removed `any` types
2. **Zod Validation**: 100% of pages implement input validation
3. **Redis Caching**: Consistent caching strategy across all queries
4. **Import Patterns**: All use @repo/* imports exclusively
5. **No Console Logs**: Removed from production code
6. **Server Components**: Default pattern with selective client usage

### ðŸ”§ Areas Needing Attention
1. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented globally but needs endpoint-specific tuning
2. **Error Boundaries**: Basic implementation, needs enhancement
3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Not yet enabled project-wide
4. **Security Headers**: Basic setup, needs comprehensive configuration

## Known Issues and TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Missing Pages**: Implement critical missing pages (create listing, edit listing, seller onboarding)
2. **Security**: Add CSRF protection, enhance rate limiting, implement audit logging
3. **Performance**: Optimize database queries, implement query batching, add performance budgets
4. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels, improve keyboard navigation, test with screen readers

### Medium Priority
1. **UX Enhancements**: Add optimistic updates, improve loading states, implement skeleton screens
2. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking, performance monitoring, user analytics
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests for critical flows
4. **Documentation**: API documentation, component documentation, deployment guides

- Haptic feedback for actions
- Bottom sheet navigation patterns
- Progressive web app features

## Performance Standards

### Current Metrics
- **Initial Load**: ~2.5s (target: <2s)
- **Time to Interactive**: ~3.5s (target: <3s)
- **Core Web Vitals**: Passing but needs optimization

### Optimization Strategy
1. Implement lazy loading for images and components
2. Add virtual scrolling for large lists
3. Optimize bundle size with code splitting
4. Implement service worker for offline support
5. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
1. **TypeScript**: Strict mode with no implicit any
2. **Components**: Server Components by default
3. **Styling**: Tailwind utilities with semantic class names
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for utilities, integration tests for flows
5. **Documentation**: JSDoc for complex functions

### Workflow
1. **PLAN**: Analyze requirements thoroughly
2. **REVIEW**: Identify edge cases and security concerns
3. **EXECUTE**: Write clean, production-ready code
4. **VERIFY**: Run typecheck and build before committing

### Best Practices
1. Include database relations in initial queries
2. Use cache.remember() for all cacheable data
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add loading states for all async operations
5. Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas
