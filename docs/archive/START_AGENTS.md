# 🚀 Launch Your Autonomous Agents

## ⚡ Quick Start (1 Command)

```bash
# 1. Start the orchestrator MCP server
cd packages/claude-orchestrator && pnpm dev
```

Then in Claude Code, run:
```
start_workflow goal="Build production-ready Threadly marketplace following PROJECT.md vision"
```

**That's it!** The orchestrator will:
- ✅ Read PROJECT.md vision automatically
- ✅ Analyze the entire codebase
- ✅ Create implementation plan
- ✅ Spawn specialized agents in isolated worktrees
- ✅ Work autonomously toward the vision

## 🎯 What The Agents Will Do

### **Phase 1: Research (30 mins)**
- Global codebase analysis
- TypeScript error audit
- Compare current state vs PROJECT.md goals
- Identify critical gaps and opportunities

### **Phase 2: Planning (20 mins)**  
- Create prioritized task breakdown
- Assign tasks to specialized agents
- Set up parallel worktree development
- Estimate effort and dependencies

### **Phase 3: Implementation (4-6 hours)**
- **Researcher Agent**: Continuous analysis and reporting
- **Implementer Agent**: Build marketplace features  
- **Reviewer Agent**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Specialist Agent**: Backend/API development

### **Phase 4: Verification (30 mins)**
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance validation
- Security checks
- Production readiness

## 📊 Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check agent status
agent_status

# View workflow progress  
workflow_status

# Get session summary
get_session_summary

# View research findings
research_codebase

# Emergency stop
emergency_stop
```

## 🎯 The Vision They're Building

**PROJECT.md contains the complete vision:**
