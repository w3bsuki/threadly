# API Service Production Readiness Audit

**Audit Date:** January 5, 2025  
**API Directory:** `/home/w3bsuki/threadly/apps/api`

## Executive Summary

The API service shows a mix of production-ready features and significant gaps. While core functionality for products, orders, and users is implemented with proper database queries, several critical areas need attention before production deployment.

## Mock Data Usage

### Routes Returning Fake/Stub Data
1. **`/api/search/index`** - Returns placeholder message, no indexing functionality
   - Status: "not_implemented"
   - Returns: `{ message: 'This endpoint is a placeholder' }`

2. **`/api/search/popular`** - Returns empty products array
   - Returns: `{ products: [], message: 'Popular products endpoint not yet implemented' }`

3. **`/api/search/suggestions`** - Returns empty suggestions array
   - Returns: `{ suggestions: [], message: 'Search suggestions endpoint not yet implemented' }`

### Hardcoded Values
1. **`/api/stripe/connect`** - Hardcoded country value
   - Line 36: `country: 'US', // TODO: Get from user profile`
   - Impact: All Stripe accounts created as US-based regardless of user location

## Missing Features

### Incomplete Endpoints
1. **Search Functionality** - 3 of 4 search endpoints are stubs
   - `/api/search/index` - No indexing capability
   - `/api/search/popular` - No popular products logic
   - `/api/search/suggestions` - No suggestion generation

2. **API Versioning** - Partially implemented
   - `/api/v1/` exists but only has products endpoint
   - Most endpoints are not versioned (directly under `/api/`)
   - No consistent versioning strategy

### Missing Core Features
1. **Pagination** - Inconsistent implementation
   - Some routes have proper pagination (favorites, messages)
   - Others missing entirely (addresses, cart)

2. **Bulk Operations** - Not implemented
   - No bulk delete/update endpoints
   - No batch processing capabilities

3. **Data Export** - Not implemented
   - No endpoints for user data export (GDPR compliance)

## Performance Issues

### Missing Rate Limiting (Critical)
- **14 of 32 routes** (~44%) implement rate limiting
- **18 routes** have NO rate limiting protection:
  - `/api/addresses/*`
  - `/api/cart/*` (all cart operations)
  - `/api/reviews`
  - `/api/search/*` (all search endpoints)
  - `/api/stripe/connect`
  - `/api/webhooks/*` (webhook endpoints)

### Database Query Optimization Needed
1. **N+1 Query Risks**
   - Reviews endpoint includes nested relations without optimization
   - Cart endpoint includes multiple nested relations

2. **Missing Database Indexes** (needs verification)
   - Frequent queries by userId, productId, orderId
   - Search queries would benefit from full-text indexes

### Caching Opportunities
1. **No caching implemented** in any API routes
   - Product listings could be cached
   - Category listings are static and ideal for caching
   - User suggestions could be cached per session

## Security Vulnerabilities

### Authentication/Authorization Gaps
1. **Inconsistent Auth Implementation**
   - Some routes use `currentUser()` from @repo/auth
   - Others use `auth()` from @repo/auth/server
   - Cart routes use different auth pattern than others

2. **Missing Authorization Checks**
   - No role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
   - Admin endpoints not protected beyond basic auth
   - No API key authentication for programmatic access

3. **Webhook Security**
   - Auth webhook validates signatures properly ✓
   - Payment webhook validates signatures properly ✓
   - But webhooks are not rate-limited ✗

### Input Validation Issues
1. **Inconsistent Validation**
   - Most routes use Zod schemas ✓
   - But validation error responses are inconsistent
   - No request size limits defined

2. **Missing Sanitization**
   - Messages route sanitizes content ✓
   - Other text inputs (reviews, product descriptions) not sanitized

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Good:** All database queries use Prisma ORM (no raw SQL found)
- **Risk:** Using `any` type in reviews route (line 32) bypasses TypeScript safety

## Error Handling and Logging Issues

### Console.log Usage (Production Anti-pattern)
Found **6 console.error statements** in production code:
- `/api/cart/route.ts` - 4 instances
- `/api/cart/clear/route.ts` - 1 instance
- `/api/cart/[productId]/route.ts` - 1 instance

Should use `logError` from `@repo/observability/server` instead.

### Inconsistent Error Responses
1. **Multiple response formats:**
   - Some use `{ error: string }`
   - Others use `{ success: false, error: string }`
   - API response helper exists but not consistently used

2. **Information Leakage**
   - Some errors expose internal details
   - Stack traces could be exposed in production

## Missing API Documentation
1. **No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation**
2. **No API versioning documentation**
3. **No rate limit documentation**
4. **No authentication documentation**

## Action Items

### Critical (P0 - Must fix before production)
1. **Implement rate limiting on all endpoints** (18 routes missing)
2. **Replace console.log with proper logging** (6 instances)
3. **Implement search functionality** (3 stub endpoints)
4. **Standardize authentication approach** across all routes
5. **Add request size limits** to prevent DoS attacks

### High Priority (P1 - Should fix soon)
1. **Implement consistent API versioning strategy**
2. **Add caching layer** for frequently accessed data
3. **Standardize error responses** using APIResponseBuilder
4. **Add input sanitization** for all text inputs
5. **Implement CORS properly** for API endpoints
6. **Add API documentation** (OpenAPI spec)

### Medium Priority (P2 - Plan for next sprint)
1. **Add bulk operations** for efficiency
2. **Implement data export endpoints** (GDPR compliance)
3. **Add database query optimization** (indexes, query analysis)
4. **Implement API key authentication** for programmatic access
5. **Add request/response compression**

### Low Priority (P3 - Future enhancements)
1. **Add GraphQL endpoint** as alternative to REST
2. **Implement webhook retry logic**
3. **Add API usage analytics**
4. **Implement response pagination cursors** (vs offset)

## Positive Findings

1. **Good use of TypeScript** and type safety (mostly)
2. **Proper Zod validation** on most endpoints
3. **Transaction usage** for data consistency
4. **Webhook signature validation** implemented correctly
5. **CSRF protection** in middleware
6. **Security headers** via nosecone
7. **Proper async/await** error handling
8. **Good separation of concerns** in route structure

## Recommendations

1. **Create API standards document** defining:
   - Consistent response format
   - Error handling patterns
   - Rate limiting tiers
   - Versioning strategy

2. **Implement monitoring** for:
   - API response times
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Rate limit violations
   - Database query performance

3. **Security audit** focusing on:
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - API-specific security risks
   - Third-party dependency vulnerabilities

4. **Load testing** to identify:
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Optimal rate limits
   - Database connection pooling needs

## Conclusion

The API service has a solid foundation but requires significant work before production deployment. The most critical issues are the lack of rate limiting on 56% of endpoints and the presence of stub implementations for search functionality. Addressing the P0 and P1 items should be the immediate focus to ensure a secure and reliable API service.
