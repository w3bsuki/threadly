# Next-Forge Overview

## 🌟 What is Next-Forge?

Next-Forge is a production-grade Next.js template built on the philosophy of being **Fast, Cheap, Opinionated, Modern, and Safe**. It provides a comprehensive turborepo monorepo structure with pre-configured tooling, shared packages, and best practices for building scalable web applications.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### Fast
- **Performance-first** - Optimized builds, caching strategies, and runtime performance
- **Developer Experience** - Fast development cycles with hot reload and efficient tooling
- **Build Speed** - Optimized Turborepo builds with intelligent caching

### Cheap
- **Resource Efficient** - Minimal infrastructure costs with smart architecture
- **Deployment Optimized** - Vercel-optimized builds and edge functions
- **Bundle Optimization** - Tree-shaking, code splitting, and minimal dependencies

### Opinionated
- **Conventions over Configuration** - Established patterns reduce decision fatigue
- **Consistent Architecture** - Standardized structure across all parts of the application
- **Pre-configured Tooling** - ESLint, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more out of the box

### Modern
- **Latest Technologies** - Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5.x
- **Modern Patterns** - App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- **Edge Computing** - Vercel Edge Runtime and optimizations

### Safe
- **Type Safety** - End-to-end TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Environment Validation** - Runtime environment variable validation with Zod
- **Security Best Practices** - Built-in security patterns and validation

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Monorepo Structure
```
apps/                   # Application packages
├── web/               # Customer-facing website
├── app/               # Administrative dashboard  
└── api/               # Backend API services

packages/              # Shared packages
├── auth/              # Authentication logic
├── database/          # Database schema and client
├── design-system/     # UI components
├── validation/        # Input validation schemas
└── ...               # Other shared utilities
```

### Shared Package Philosophy
- **Single Responsibility** - Each package has a clear, focused purpose
- **Dependency Management** - Proper dependency boundaries and imports
- **Reusability** - Code that can be shared across multiple apps
- **Type Safety** - Fully typed interfaces between packages

### Environment Management
- **Type-Safe Environment Variables** - Using @t3-oss/env-nextjs
- **Modular Configuration** - Each package manages its own environment keys
- **Runtime Validation** - Zod schemas ensure environment correctness
- **Development vs Production** - Different validation rules for different environments

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15** - App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- **React 19** - Latest React features and optimizations
- **TypeScript 5.x** - Strict type checking and modern features

### Build & Development
- **Turborepo** - Monorepo build system with intelligent caching
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk-efficient package manager
- **ESLint + Biome** - Code linting and formatting

### Database & State
- **Prisma** - Type-safe database client and migrations
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching layer (Upstash)
- **Zustand** - Client-side state management

### Authentication & Security
- **Clerk** - Authentication and user management
- **@t3-oss/env-nextjs** - Environment variable validation
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Composable UI component library
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives

### Observability & Monitoring
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **BetterStack** - Logging and uptime monitoring
- **PostHog** - Analytics and feature flags

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Set up database
pnpm db:push
```

### 2. Development
```bash
# Start all apps in development
pnpm dev

# Run specific app
pnpm dev --filter=@repo/web
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```bash
# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Testing
pnpm test
```

### 4. Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Deploy to Vercel
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Benefits of Next-Forge

### For Developers
- **Reduced Setup Time** - Skip configuration, start building features
- **Consistent Patterns** - Familiar structure across projects
- **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Performance by Default** - Optimized builds and runtime performance

### For Teams
- **Shared Standards** - Everyone follows the same patterns
- **Code Reusability** - Shared packages reduce duplication
- **Scalable Architecture** - Grows with your team and product
- **Documentation** - Well-documented patterns and conventions

### For Businesses
- **Faster Time to Market** - Pre-built solutions for common problems
- **Lower Maintenance Costs** - Well-architected code is easier to maintain
- **Scalability** - Architecture that grows with your business
- **Security** - Built-in security best practices

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Composition over Inheritance
- Components compose together rather than extending base classes
- Shared logic in custom hooks and utility functions
- Flexible, reusable patterns

### Server-First Architecture
- Server Components by default
- Client Components only when necessary
- Edge-optimized serverless functions

### Type-Driven Development
- Schema-first API design with Zod
- Database-first with Prisma
- Environment-first with @t3-oss/env-nextjs

## 🔐 Security Model

### Input Validation
- **All user inputs validated** - Zod schemas for API routes and forms
- **SQL Injection Prevention** - Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection** - Input sanitization and CSP headers

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication** - Clerk handles token management
- **Role-based Access Control** - Implemented at the application level
- **Session Management** - Secure session handling with HTTP-only cookies

### Environment Security
- **Secret Management** - Environment variables never committed to code
- **Runtime Validation** - Environment variables validated at startup
- **Production Overrides** - Different validation rules for production
