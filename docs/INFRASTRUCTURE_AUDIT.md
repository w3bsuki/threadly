- No remote caching configured
- Build outputs could be more specific

### TypeScript Configuration
**Strengths:**
- Strict mode enabled
- Modern ES2022 target
- NodeNext module resolution
- Consistent across workspace

**Issues:**
- Missing `typecheck` task in turbo.json
- No composite project setup for faster builds

### Next.js Configurations
**Strengths:**
- Consistent HOC pattern for middleware
- Good observability integration
- Proper image optimization setup
- Environment-specific configurations

**Performance Concerns:**
- Multiple Sentry/logging integrations may impact performance
- Webpack customizations across apps
- No bundle analysis by default

## üîß Scripts & Tooling Assessment

### Deployment Infrastructure
**Excellent deployment script (`scripts/deploy.sh`):**
- Comprehensive validation and health checks
- Multi-environment support
- Proper error handling and cleanup
- Notification system integration
- Database migration management

### Development Workflow
**Good practices:**
- Automated linting and formatting
- Type checking across workspace
- Database seeding scripts
- Health check endpoints

**Areas for improvement:**
- Missing typecheck task integration
- No performance benchmarking
- Limited testing automation

### CI/CD Pipeline Assessment
**Strengths:**
- Multi-matrix builds (app, web, api)
- Proper test database setup
- Security scanning integration
- Staging/production deployment workflow
- Coverage reporting

**Optimizations needed:**
- Cache strategy could be improved
- Build artifacts caching
- Parallel job optimization

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

### License Compliance
**Status:** Generally compliant
- Mix of MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD licenses
- Some dual-licensed packages (AFL-2.1 OR BSD-3-Clause)
- No GPL or restrictive licenses detected

### Supply Chain Security
**Concerns:**
- 3,296 packages increase attack surface
- Some packages have known vulnerabilities
- Deep dependency tree complexity

**Mitigations in place:**
- pnpm security overrides
- Automated security scanning in CI
- Snyk integration for vulnerability detection

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Build Performance
**Current Issues:**
- `typecheck` task missing from turbo.json
- No remote caching configured
- Large node_modules impact on CI times

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Implement Turborepo remote caching
- Add incremental TypeScript builds
- Optimize Docker layer caching
- Bundle analysis integration

### Development Performance
