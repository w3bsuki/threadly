## üöÄ Quick Start (Minimal Setup)

For a minimal development setup, you only need these 4 services:

1. **Clerk** (Authentication)
2. **Neon** (Database) 
3. **Stripe** (Payments)
4. **Uploadthing** (File uploads)

## üìù Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clerk Authentication Setup
1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Go to "API Keys" in the dashboard
4. Copy the "Secret key" and "Publishable key"
5. Add them to your `.env.local` file

### 2. Neon Database Setup
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and sign up
2. Create a new project
3. Go to "Dashboard" ‚Üí "Connection Details"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Add it as `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env.local` file

### 3. Stripe Payments Setup
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and sign up
2. Go to "Developers" ‚Üí "API keys"
3. Use the test keys for development
4. Copy "Secret key" and "Publishable key"
5. Add them to your `.env.local` file

### 4. Uploadthing Setup
1. Go to [uploadthing.com](https://uploadthing.com) and sign up
2. Create a new app
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Copy your secret and app ID
5. Add them to your `.env.local` file

## üîÑ After Setup

Once you've created your `.env.local` file:

1. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   cd apps/app
   pnpm migrate
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Visit:
   - Main app: http://localhost:3000
   - Web landing: http://localhost:3001  
   - Storybook: http://localhost:6006
   - Docs: http://localhost:3002

## üéØ Marketplace-Specific Considerations

For our Vinted clone, make sure to:

1. **Enable Stripe Connect** in your Stripe dashboard for marketplace payments
2. **Configure Clerk** with custom user fields for seller profiles
3. **Set up Uploadthing** with appropriate file size limits for product images
4. **Configure email templates** in Resend for order confirmations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- If you get authentication errors, check your Clerk keys
- If database errors occur, verify your DATABASE_URL
- For payment issues, ensure Stripe keys are correct
- For image upload problems, check Uploadthing configuration

## üîê Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Use test keys for development
- Switch to production keys only when deploying
- Regularly rotate your API keys
