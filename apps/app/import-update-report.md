## Issues Found

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
The following issues remain after the import updates:

1. **Missing @repo/ui Package**: Multiple files import from `@repo/ui/components` which appears to be a valid package that wasn't part of the consolidation.

2. **Missing Dependencies**: Several packages have missing dependencies that need to be installed.

3. **Unused Variables**: Various files have unused variable warnings that should be addressed separately.

## Recommendations

1. Run `pnpm install` at the root level to ensure all workspace dependencies are resolved.

2. The `@repo/ui` package appears to be missing or not properly linked. This needs to be investigated.

3. Address the unused variable warnings in a separate cleanup task.

4. Consider creating index files in the consolidated packages to re-export commonly used modules for easier imports.

## Conclusion

The import path updates have been successfully completed for all 108 files in the apps/app directory. The main remaining issues are related to missing packages and dependencies rather than incorrect import paths.
