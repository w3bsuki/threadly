## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Business Logic First
- Tests focus on business rules and user workflows
- Edge cases and error conditions thoroughly covered
- Real-world scenarios with proper data validation

### 2. Security by Design
- Input validation and sanitization tests
- Authentication and authorization verification
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### 3. User Experience Validation
- Mobile-responsive component testing
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Loading states and error handling

### 4. Integration Coverage
- Database transaction testing
- Cross-service communication validation
- State synchronization verification

## Performance Benchmarks

### API Response Time Targets
- **Product Listing**: <200ms (tested with pagination)
- **User Authentication**: <100ms (Clerk integration)
- **Payment Processing**: <500ms (Stripe API calls)
- **Cart Operations**: <50ms (local state + sync)

### UI Rendering Benchmarks
- **Product Cards**: <16ms render time
- **Filter Application**: <100ms state update
- **Mobile Interactions**: 60fps touch responsiveness

## Continuous Integration

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run specific test suite
pnpm test payment-flows

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch
```

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for critical paths
- **Test Performance**: All tests complete <30 seconds
- **Zero Flaky Tests**: Deterministic, reliable execution
- **Security Validation**: All vulnerability tests pass

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing patterns and file organization
2. Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario
3. Include both success and failure cases
4. Add security considerations for new features
5. Update this README with new test categories

### Mock Management
- Keep mocks in sync with actual API contracts
- Use typed mocks with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Avoid over-mocking - test real integration where possible
- Document mock assumptions and limitations

### Test Data
- Use realistic, representative test data
- Avoid hardcoded IDs or brittle assumptions
- Generate dynamic test data where appropriate
- Keep test data secure (no real credentials)

## Security Testing Focus

### Critical Security Tests
1. **Payment Security**: Webhook verification, amount validation
2. **Authentication Security**: Token validation, session management
3. **Input Security**: SQL injection, XSS prevention
4. **Access Control**: User authorization, resource ownership
5. **Rate Limiting**: Abuse prevention, fair usage
