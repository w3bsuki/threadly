# Welcome to Threadly Design System

Welcome to the comprehensive design system for Threadly - a modern, accessible, and scalable foundation for building consistent user interfaces across all Threadly applications.

## What is Threadly Design System?

The Threadly Design System is a collection of reusable components, design tokens, and guidelines that help teams build consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

### Key Features

- **50+ Pre-built Components**: From basic buttons to complex data tables, all following shadcn/ui patterns
- **Design Tokens**: Comprehensive token system for colors, typography, spacing, and more
- **Accessibility First**: All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Dark Mode Support**: Seamless theme switching with optimized color palettes
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly targets and responsive behaviors
- **Performance Focused**: Lazy loading, tree-shaking, and optimized bundles

## Design Philosophy

### 1. **Minimalist & Functional**
We believe in clean, purposeful design that puts functionality first. Every element serves a purpose, and nothing is purely decorative.

### 2. **Consistency is Key**
Using consistent patterns, spacing, and interactions creates a predictable and learnable interface that users can navigate confidently.

### 3. **Accessibility for All**
Every component is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring our products are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

Fast, responsive interfaces create better user experiences. We optimize for performance at every level.
