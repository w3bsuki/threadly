# Threadly Web - Production Readiness Plan

## Overview
Threadly is a premium C2C fashion marketplace. The UI/UX is clean and well-designed. This plan focuses on making everything functional, fast, and production-ready.

## Current State âœ…
- Clean, modern UI design
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Good product card design
- Working authentication (Clerk)
- Database and API structure in place

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Upload Product Flow (FIXED âœ…)
**Issue**: `/selling/new` returns 404 error
**Root Cause**: Selling features were only in the app (port 3000), not web (port 3001)
**Solution Implemented**: 
- Created `/selling/new` route in web app with helpful onboarding flow
- Created `/selling/onboarding` route for seller setup
- Updated all "Sell" buttons to use internal routes
- Provides seamless experience with temporary redirect to full dashboard
**Status**: RESOLVED - Users can now access selling features directly from web app

### 2. Non-Functional Buttons (FIXED âœ…)
**Issues Found & Fixed**:
- Size filter buttons now properly toggle selection
- "Enable Price Alerts" marked as "Coming Soon"
- "Share Favorites" marked as "Coming Soon"
- All category routes exist (/men, /women, /kids, /unisex, /designer)
- Bottom nav links all work correctly

## Remaining Issues to Fix ðŸš¨

### 1. Search & Filters
**Issues**:
- Ensure search actually queries products
- Filters must update results
- Category filtering should work
- Price/size/brand filters functional

**Must Work Perfectly**:
- Browse â†’ View Product â†’ Purchase
- Sign Up â†’ Create Profile â†’ List Item
