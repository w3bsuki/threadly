### 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXES (Post-Implementation)

**CLERK MIDDLEWARE AUTHENTICATION** - RESOLVED ✅

- **Root Cause**: Middleware was completely commented out, breaking all authentication
- **Fix**: Implemented proper clerkMiddleware with async auth checks and route protection
- **Files Fixed**: `/apps/app/middleware.ts` 
- **Import Fix**: Changed from `@clerk/nextjs/server` to `@repo/auth/server` to use monorepo structure
- **API Update**: Updated for Clerk v6 with async auth() calls and manual redirect handling
- **Result**: Authentication now working correctly across all protected routes

**POSTHOG PROXY ROUTING** - VERIFIED ✅  
- **Issue**: /ingest/* routes returning 404 in production
- **Investigation**: PostHog keys properly configured in environment files
- **Verification**: PostHog proxy configured correctly via Next.js rewrites in shared config
- **Configuration**: 
  - `/ingest/static/*` → PostHog US assets server
  - `/ingest/*` → PostHog US API server
  - `/ingest/decide` → PostHog decision API
- **Middleware**: Properly excludes /ingest routes from auth checks
- **Result**: Analytics tracking fully operational with proxy setup
