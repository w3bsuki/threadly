---

## 🛠️ Technical Patterns & Standards

### Next.js 15 Requirements
```typescript
// Async params MUST be awaited
export default async function Page({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: Promise<{ id: string }> 
}) {
  const { id } = await params; // REQUIRED
}
```

### Import Rules
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use package exports
import { Button } from '@repo/design-system/components';

// ❌ WRONG - No deep imports
import { Button } from '@repo/design-system/components/ui/button';
```

### Quality Gates
- Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ No `any` types (Fixed: 86→6 with proper types)
- ✅ No console.log in production (Fixed: 13→0 files)
- All tests passing
- Successful build

#### Code Quality Improvements (2025-01-07)
- **TypeScript any types**: Reduced from 86 to 6 strategic assertions
- **Console statements**: Removed from production (13 files cleaned)
- **Type safety**: Enhanced with proper Prisma types
- **Error handling**: Upgraded to structured logging with @repo/observability
