# Threadly Implementation Plan

## Current Focus: Production Push

### Phase 1: Performance Optimization (Current)
**Goal**: Improve web app performance with caching

#### Task: Add Redis Caching to Web App
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm add @repo/cache
   ```

2. **Cache Implementation Points**
   - Product listings (5 min TTL)
   - Category data (10 min TTL)
   - Search suggestions (5 min TTL)
   - User favorites count (1 min TTL)

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Use cache-aside pattern
   - Implement cache invalidation on updates
   - Add cache warming for popular products
   - Monitor cache hit rates

4. **Files to Update**
   - `apps/web/app/[locale]/(home)/components/product-grid-server.tsx`
   - `apps/web/app/[locale]/(home)/components/featured-categories.tsx`
   - `apps/web/app/[locale]/(home)/components/new-arrivals.tsx`
   - `apps/web/app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`

### Phase 2: Email Reliability
**Goal**: Implement retry mechanism for failed emails

1. **Retry Strategy**
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
   - Max 5 retries
   - Store failed emails in database
   - Background job to retry failed emails

2. **Implementation**
   - Create email queue table
   - Implement retry service
   - Add monitoring for failed emails
   - Set up alerts for persistent failures

### Phase 3: Search Enhancement
**Goal**: Add Algolia search indexing

1. **Index Structure**
   ```typescript
   {
     objectID: string,
     title: string,
     description: string,
     price: number,
     category: string,
     seller: string,
     images: string[],
     createdAt: number,
     _tags: string[]
   }
   ```

2. **Indexing Points**
   - On product creation
   - On product update
   - Batch reindex command
   - Remove on product deletion

3. **Search Features**
   - Instant search
   - Faceted search by category
   - Price range filtering
   - Relevance ranking

### Phase 4: Order Model Extension
**Goal**: Add shipping details to orders

1. **Schema Changes**
   ```prisma
   model Order {
     // ... existing fields
     shippingAddress   String?
     shippingCity      String?
     shippingState     String?
     shippingZip       String?
     shippingCountry   String?
     trackingNumber    String?
     shippedAt         DateTime?
     deliveredAt       DateTime?
   }
   ```

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Create migration script
   - Backfill existing orders
   - Update order creation flow
   - Add tracking UI

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2s
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- Email delivery rate > 95%
- Search response time < 200ms
- Zero data loss during migrations

## Risk Mitigation
- Test caching thoroughly in staging
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance metrics
- Have rollback plan ready
- Document all changes

## Timeline
- Week 1: Redis caching implementation
- Week 2: Email retry + Search indexing
- Week 3: Order model extension + Testing
- Week 4: Production deployment

## Notes
- Keep changes isolated to prevent regression
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Update documentation as we go
- Coordinate with team on deployments
