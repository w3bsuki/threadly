## ðŸ§  DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY

### Always Follow
1. **One task at a time** - Complete fully before moving on
2. **Test immediately** - Verify each change works
3. **Mobile-first** - Every feature must work on phone
4. **Real data only** - No mocks or placeholders
5. **Error handling** - Graceful failures for everything

### Quality Gates
- Every page must load without errors
- Every link must go somewhere real
- Every form must validate and submit
- Every image must display properly
- Every payment must process correctly

## ðŸš€ EXECUTION PRINCIPLES

1. **Start with /app directory** - Fix the authenticated dashboard first
2. **Fix navigation first** - Can't test features with 404 errors
3. **Complete user journeys** - End-to-end flows working
4. **Test on mobile** - Primary target audience
5. **Deploy early and often** - Catch production issues fast

This plan transforms Threadly from a sophisticated demo into a production-ready marketplace in phases, with each phase delivering working functionality that can be tested by real users.
