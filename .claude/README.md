# .claude Directory

This directory serves as the "brain" for Claude when working on this project. It maintains context and state across sessions.

## Purpose

The `.claude` directory helps maintain continuity when Claude works on your project across different sessions. It's the single source of truth for project state.

## Key Files

- **`STATUS.md`** - Current project status and overview (START HERE)
- **`todo.md`** - Detailed task list and session history
- **`BRAIN.md`** - How this system works
- **`PROJECT.md`** - Technical architecture details
- **`decisions.md`** - Technical choices and reasoning
- **`REAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** - Production deployment roadmap
- **`PRODUCTION_REALITY_CHECK.md`** - Critical issues and fixes

## Usage

When starting a new session:
1. Read `STATUS.md` for current state
2. Check `todo.md` for active tasks
3. Update files after making progress

This allows Claude to quickly understand where things left off and continue productively.
