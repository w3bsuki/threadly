# 📋 THREADLY REFACTOR TODO

*Next-Forge Architecture Implementation - Active Task Tracking*
*Started: January 9, 2025*

## 🎯 REFACTOR OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Transform to Next-Forge best practices while preserving all working functionality  
**Timeline:** 8 days (4 phases)  
**Current Phase:** Planning & Preparation  

**📋 Master Documents:**
- `AUDIT.md` - Codebase analysis and issues found
- `REFACTOR.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `STATUS.md` - Current working functionality (PRESERVE)

---

## 🚨 PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Days 1-2) - Environment & Structure

### Day 1: Environment Consolidation 
**Status:** 🟡 Ready to Start  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Centralize env vars (30+ → <15) without breaking functionality

#### Morning Tasks (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Create packages/env package structure**
  - [ ] Create `packages/env/src/base.ts` - Core environment validation
  - [ ] Create `packages/env/src/auth.ts` - Clerk environment vars
  - [ ] Create `packages/env/src/payments.ts` - Stripe environment vars
  - [ ] Create `packages/env/src/database.ts` - Database environment vars
  - [ ] Create `packages/env/package.json` with dependencies

#### Afternoon Tasks (2-3 hours)  
- [ ] **Update app environment files (safe)**
  - [ ] Replace `apps/app/env.ts` with centralized imports
  - [ ] Replace `apps/api/env.ts` with centralized imports  
  - [ ] Replace `apps/web/env.ts` with centralized imports
  - [ ] **Validation:** `pnpm dev` still works, `pnpm build` passes

### Day 2: Database Singleton Pattern
**Status:** 🟡 Ready to Start  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Ensure single Prisma client instance

#### Morning Tasks (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Implement database singleton pattern**
  - [ ] Update `packages/database/src/client.ts` with global singleton
  - [ ] Add development logging configuration
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing imports
  - [ ] **Validation:** All database operations still work

#### Afternoon Tasks (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Audit package dependencies**
  - [ ] Run `npx madge --circular` to identify circular dependencies
  - [ ] Create dependency graph visualization
  - [ ] Document package independence violations
  - [ ] Create Phase 2 action plan

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE (Days 3-4) - Package Independence

### Day 3: Fix Package Independence Violations
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Phase 1  
**Risk:** Medium  
**Goal:** Eliminate cross-package imports

#### Critical Fixes Required
- [ ] **Fix auth package imports @repo/database**
  - [ ] Create interface-based dependency injection pattern
  - [ ] Update `packages/auth/src/server.ts` to use interfaces
  - [ ] Update apps to inject database dependency
  - [ ] **Validation:** Authentication still works

- [ ] **Fix notifications package imports @repo/database**
  - [ ] Apply same interface pattern as auth
  - [ ] Update email notification logic
  - [ ] **Validation:** Email notifications still work

### Day 4: Component Architecture Review  
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Day 3  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Optimize server vs client components

- [ ] **Run component audit script**
  - [ ] Identify unnecessary 'use client' directives
  - [ ] Find server components that could be optimized
  - [ ] **⚠️ DO NOT TOUCH:** Image upload, forms, navigation (working)

---

## ⚡ PHASE 3: PERFORMANCE (Days 5-6) - Optimization

### Day 5: Caching Implementation  
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Phase 2  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Add Next.js 15 caching for better performance

- [ ] **Create caching package**
  - [ ] Implement `unstable_cache` wrapper utilities
  - [ ] Add request-level memoization helpers
  - [ ] Create cache invalidation patterns

- [ ] **Implement safe caching**
  - [ ] Cache category data (rarely changes)
  - [ ] Cache user profile data (with proper invalidation)
  - [ ] **Validation:** All dynamic content still updates

### Day 6: Bundle Optimization
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Day 5  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Reduce bundle size and improve loading

- [ ] **Update Next.js configurations**
  - [ ] Add `optimizePackageImports` to next.config.ts files
  - [ ] Configure tree-shaking for design system
  - [ ] **Validation:** Build times improve, bundle size reduces

---

## 🧪 PHASE 4: QUALITY (Days 7-8) - Polish & Testing

### Day 7: Error Handling Standardization
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Phase 3  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Consistent error patterns across APIs

- [ ] **Create global error handling package**
  - [ ] Standardize API error responses
  - [ ] Add proper error logging
  - [ ] **Validation:** Error UX improves, no new bugs

### Day 8: Testing & Final Validation
**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Day 7  
**Risk:** Low  
**Goal:** Comprehensive validation of refactor

- [ ] **Comprehensive testing**
  - [ ] Full manual testing of all features
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking
  - [ ] Bundle analysis
  - [ ] TypeScript strict mode validation

## 🛡️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### ❌ NEVER TOUCH (Working Production Code)
- ✅ Authentication middleware (`apps/app/middleware.ts`)
- ✅ Image upload logic (data URL approach working)
- ✅ Form validation (all Zod schemas)
- ✅ Database schema (`schema.prisma`)
- ✅ Real-time messaging (Pusher integration)
- ✅ Payment processing (Stripe Connect)
- ✅ Cart system (Zustand store)
- ✅ Dashboard layout and navigation

### 🧪 Daily Validation (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Before each day's work
pnpm dev & sleep 10 && kill $!  # Smoke test
pnpm build                      # Build verification
pnpm typecheck                  # Type safety

# After each day's work  
pnpm dev                        # Full manual testing
pnpm build                      # Final build check
git add . && git commit -m "refactor: day X complete"
```

---

## 📊 COMPLETED FEATURES (PRESERVE)

### ✅ Working Core Features (96% Complete)
- Dashboard & Navigation - Mobile-responsive, working pages
- Product Management - Create/edit/list with image uploads  
- Categories - 9 categories seeded and working
- Form Validation - Zod schemas, proper error handling
- Authentication - Clerk integration functional
- Real-time Messaging - Pusher implementation working
- Cart System - Zustand store functional
- Payment Processing - Stripe Connect integration
- Address Management - CRUD operations working
- Email Notifications - Working with proper templates

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Must Maintain (Zero Tolerance)
- [ ] ✅ All current features continue working
- [ ] ✅ Dashboard loads and navigation works
- [ ] ✅ Product creation/editing functional
- [ ] ✅ Image uploads work (data URL approach)
- [ ] ✅ Authentication and real-time messaging
- [ ] ✅ Build success across all apps
- [ ] ✅ TypeScript compilation clean

### Target Improvements
- [ ] 📈 Environment variables: 30+ → <15
- [ ] 📈 Package independence: 0 cross-imports
- [ ] 📈 Build performance: <2min target
- [ ] 📈 Bundle optimization: Tree-shaking active
- [ ] 📈 Caching: Next.js 15 features implemented

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK

### If Something Breaks
```bash
# Immediate rollback
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or return to last known good state
git checkout main
```

### Rollback Points
- End of each day (working state commit)
- Before each major architectural change
- After each phase completion
