# âœ… THREADLY TODO LIST - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

> Active task tracking for getting this shit ACTUALLY WORKING in production

*Last Updated: January 10, 2025*

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - PRODUCTION IS BROKEN

**THE PROBLEM**: Buttons/UI don't work after sign in on deployed app
**LIKELY CAUSES**: Missing env vars, CORS issues, API URLs, or build problems

---

## ðŸ”¥ IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED (Do These First!)

### 1. Environment Variables Check
- [ ] Verify ALL env vars are in Vercel:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
  
  DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
  
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (THIS IS PROBABLY MISSING!)
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
  
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  
  UPLOADTHING_SECRET
  UPLOADTHING_APP_ID
  
  PUSHER_APP_ID
  PUSHER_KEY
  PUSHER_SECRET
  PUSHER_CLUSTER
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER
  
  RESEND_API_KEY
  
  UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
  UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
  
  NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY
  NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
  ```

### 2. API Connection Issues
- [ ] Check if API routes are accessible from deployed frontend
- [ ] Verify CORS headers in API middleware
- [ ] Ensure API_URL environment variable points to correct deployed API
- [ ] Check browser console for 404s or CORS errors

### 3. Build & Deployment Issues  
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` locally and check for errors
- [ ] Verify all environment variables have defaults in code
- [ ] Check Vercel build logs for missing dependencies
- [ ] Ensure middleware.ts is not blocking requests

---

## ðŸ“‹ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Frontend Issues (/app and /web)
- [ ] Fix button click handlers not working
- [ ] Verify all API calls use correct URLs
- [ ] Check authentication state persistence
- [ ] Ensure all client components load properly
- [ ] Fix any hydration mismatches

### API Issues (/api)
- [ ] Verify all routes return proper CORS headers
- [ ] Check database connection in production
- [ ] Ensure rate limiting isn't blocking legitimate requests
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints are accessible

### Missing Features (UI Implementation Needed)
- [ ] Following feed UI (API exists, needs components)
- [ ] Follower count display in profiles
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for sellers
- [ ] Notification bell functionality
- [ ] Search filters UI in dashboard app

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TODAY'S PRIORITIES

### HIGH - Fix Production Deployment
1. [ ] Add all missing env vars to Vercel
2. [ ] Fix API URL configuration 
3. [ ] Test every button/form after deployment
4. [ ] Ensure data persists (cart, favorites, etc.)

### MEDIUM - Complete UI Features
1. [ ] Implement following feed page
2. [ ] Add follower/following counts to profile
3. [ ] Create seller analytics dashboard
4. [ ] Wire up notification bell

### LOW - Nice to Have
1. [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for search)
2. [ ] Help documentation page
3. [ ] Bundle size optimization
4. [ ] Image CDN configuration

---

## ðŸ”§ DEBUGGING COMMANDS

```bash
# Check production build locally
pnpm build && pnpm start

# Test with production env vars
cp .env.production .env.local
pnpm dev

# Check for missing dependencies
pnpm ls --depth=0

# Verify all apps build
turbo run build --filter=@repo/app
turbo run build --filter=@repo/web  
turbo run build --filter=@repo/api
```

## âœ… COMPLETED TODAY (January 10)

### Infrastructure & Performance
- âœ… Redis caching with Upstash
- âœ… Rate limiting on all API routes
- âœ… Service worker for offline support
- âœ… Image lazy loading
- âœ… Pull-to-refresh on mobile

### Features
- âœ… Follow/unfollow API endpoints
- âœ… PostHog analytics integration
- âœ… Dynamic sitemap generation
- âœ… Animation system
- âœ… Error pages (404, 500)
- âœ… Form validation improvements

---

## ðŸš« NO MOCK/DEMO CODE ALLOWED

Every implementation must:
- Connect to real APIs
- Use real database
- Handle real authentication
- Process real payments
- Show real data

No placeholder text, no fake data, no "coming soon" - everything must ACTUALLY WORK!

*Focus: Get the deployed app FULLY FUNCTIONAL - every button, every feature*
